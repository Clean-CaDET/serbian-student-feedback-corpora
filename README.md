# Supplementary material for the paper "Enhancing Software and Learning with Serbian Student Feedback Corpora"

This repository contains the supplementary material for the paper "Enhancing Software and Learning with Serbian Student Feedback Corpora", where we collected and analyzed student feedback within the Intelligent Tutoring System to drive its maintenance and evolution (Crowd-based Requirements Engineering - CrowdRE) and guide future teaching methods and curriculum design by focusing on learning-related emotions. During the annotation procedure, annotators were trained based on the annotation schemas, guidelines, and examples provided in this repository in the Serbian language (folder `Srpski`). These are also translated into English (folder 'English').

## Folder `Srpski`
* `Alat_za_anotaciju.pdf` - Instructions for using the `LightTag` annotation tool in Serbian language.
* `Anotacione_instrukcije_CrowdRE` - Annotation schemas, guidelines, and examples for the CrowdRE in Serbian language.
* `Anotacione_instrukcije_Emocije` - Annotation schemas, guidelines, and examples for the aspect-based emotion detection from the text in the Serbian language.

## Folder `English`
* `Annotation_tool.pdf` - Instructions for using the `LightTag` annotation tool.
* `Annotation_instructons_CrowdRE` - Annotation schemas, guidelines, and examples for the CrowdRE.
* `Annotation_instructions_Emotions` - Annotation schemas, guidelines, and examples for the aspect-based emotion detection from text.
